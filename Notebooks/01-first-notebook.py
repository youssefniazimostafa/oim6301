"""Your first notebook.

Shared by OIM7510 and OIM6301, and used in the session Reading an error message.
Written for the first session, which did not reach it in either room, then extended
with that session's blocks on types, f-strings and error messages.

AUTHORING NOTES.

Every markdown cell carries `hide_code=True`, so a student sees the rendered
prose without the `mo.md` wrapper around it. Keep it on any cell that is only
markdown, and leave it off any cell whose code a student should read.

The four experiments ask a student to edit, delete and reorder cells, which
`--mode run` cannot do. This is written for `marimo edit` on the student's own
machine.

Python §2, §3, §6 and §10 carry `Try it` versions of some of the same ideas
(`"5" + "3"`, `import pandsa`, a `Freight: $16.75` line). Since 2026-09-12 the same
exercise may sit in both files when each serves its own file's purpose
(docs/handbooks.md). These use this notebook's own lists.

Handbook pointers are plain text, because the two course sites serve this one file
and a link would send one course to the other's site.

No cell in this file raises. Every error a student meets is one they type into a cell
of their own, so the notebook opens and exports clean.

It imports nothing but marimo, because a student's project has only `uv add marimo`
(measured 2026-09-13: `import matplotlib` raises ModuleNotFoundError there). The bar
chart is code a student pastes after running `uv add matplotlib`.

    Every section starts with a mark.

    - **▶️ Run and read.** In class this runs on screen first. Run the cell yourself and read what it shows
    - **🙋 Predict first.** Write down what you expect before you run anything
    - **✏️ Your turn.** Write the code yourself, in new cells
    - **🚀 This week's work.** Finish it after class and push it. **This week's is optional**

    Save as you go with `Ctrl+S` (Windows) or `Cmd+S` (macOS).

    # 🙋 Before You Run Anything

    Four experiments, all on the three cells you just wrote. Write all four answers down
    before you touch anything, then do them and see. They are referred to elsewhere by
    number, so **Experiment 3** means the third one below.

    1. You change `16.75` to `999.99` in the `freight_charges` cell, and run **only**
       that cell. **What happens to your three cells?**
    2. You **delete** the `freight_charges` cell. **What happens to your three cells?**
    3. Your own cell already says `total = sum(freight_charges)`. You add a new cell
       that says `total = 1`. **What happens?**
    4. You drag the cell that says `total = sum(freight_charges)` **below** the cell
       that shows `total`. **Does it still run?**

    Do them in order, and **put each one back before you start the next**: undo the
    number, retype the deleted line, delete the extra `total` cell, drag the cell back.

    *If you delete a cell by mistake, `Ctrl+Z` will not bring it back: it only undoes
    typing inside one cell. Use the **undo** button at the bottom right, which stays
    there until you close the notebook, or `Ctrl+K` and search for undo.*

    # ▶️ What Happened

    Against the four questions above, in order.

    1. **Everything that used the number recomputed by itself.** You ran one cell.
    2. **The cells using the deleted name went blank.** No cell keeps showing a value
       whose source is gone.
    3. **You got an error.** A name is defined in exactly one cell, so you can never
       be looking at a `total` that some other cell changed.
    4. **It ran.** This notebook works out what depends on what and runs in that
       order. The name for that dependency map is a **DAG**, a directed acyclic graph,
       which is why a cell cannot depend on itself. Where a cell sits on the page is a
       layout choice.

    # 🚀 A Question About Your Own Numbers

    **Optional this week.** Nothing here is required and nothing is graded on it. It is here because it is the first thing in this course that is yours rather than mine, and it is worth the hour.

    Pick a question from your own work or life that a short list of numbers can answer, such as what you spent on groceries each month since March, or how many minutes your commute took each day last week.

    **Where it goes.** A new notebook in your `notebooks/` folder, made from the page that `uv run marimo edit` opens. If you do it, commit and push it before the next session.

    **What you write.** Code, in cells. Every number in your answer comes out of a cell, and none is typed into a sentence by hand. The question, the rule and the check go in markdown cells.

    **An answer looks like this:** `Groceries from March to August cost $1,284.50, or $214.08 a month.`

    **Done looks like this:**

    1. A markdown cell with the question.
    2. Your numbers in one list, and a second list of labels (months, dates, names) in the same order. One sentence in markdown says what a single number in your list stands for.
    3. One value that arrived broken, as text or with a symbol in it, such as `"n/a"` or `"$1,200"`. Run your calculation once with it in the list and write the last line of the error in your own words. Then choose a rule for that value, state it in markdown, and apply it in code: build a clean list with a `for` loop and an `if`, the way Keep Only Some does. Delete the cell that raised, so the notebook runs clean.
    4. Your answer as one sentence printed with an f-string, from the clean list, with the numbers formatted to two decimal places.
    5. **How I know these numbers are right**: one check done a different way, such as by hand, on a calculator, or in a second cell. In OIM6301 the check has to be a cell that runs.
    6. One number changed, and a note that names what updated by itself.

    **Where AI sits in this**

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | **By hand** | Nothing in this project |
    | **AI writes, you check** | Any line of code. Ask the agent in marimo's panel, which runs on your Babson key, and read each cell before you click **Keep cell** |
    | **You direct, you verify** | The check in point 5. Choose how to check the number, and explain why that check is independent |
    | **You choose the question** | The question, and the rule for the value that arrived broken |

    **The verification question.** Pick one piece of AI output you did not accept as-is. What did it give you, what did you change, and how did you know? Point to the commit or the cell. If the agent got it right the first time: what did you do to verify that?

    > **Advanced**
    >
    > - Add a slider with `mo.ui.slider` that changes one assumption, and make your sentence follow it
    > - Draw your list as a bar chart with its labels, after running `uv add matplotlib`
    > - Answer a second question that needs something not covered yet, such as which month changed most from the one before, and explain the agent's line in your own words
    > - Send the notebook to somebody outside this course and write down the question they asked
